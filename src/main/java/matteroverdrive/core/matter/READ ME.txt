How the matter data file works:

1. Individual items are represented by "item" : <number>. For example, say we wanted
to assign a value of 10 kM to cobblestone. The entry would look like this:

    "minecraft:cobblestone" : 10
    
2. Item tags are represented by "#tag" : <number>. For example, say we wanted to assign
a value of 5 kM to all types of dirt. The entry would look like this"

    "#minecraft:dirt" : 5

3. Duplicates will be ignored. Say we have the following:

    "#minecraft:dirt" : 10,
    "#minecraft:dirt" : 5

Since the key assigning 10 to the dirt tag is before the key assigning 5, the key assigning
5 will be ignored, and all items in the dirt tag will have a value of 10 kM.

4. Items will be populated before tags when the JSON file is read. This is because tags
are not populated until the server loads, where as items are already registered by that 
point. This means you can override specific item values in a tag. For example, say we
have the following:

    "#minecraft:dirt" : 10,
    "minecraft:dirt" : 5
    
Because "minecraft:dirt" is an item, it will have its value loaded instantly, where as the
tag "#minecraft:dirt" will not be loaded until the server is loaded. The result of this would
be that the Item "Dirt" would have a value of 5 kM, where as Podzol and Grass would have values
of 10 kM.



Adding your own matter values:

1. To add your own matter values, create a file called "values.json" under the package "matter" in
a data pack. This package can either be an external data pack or in your mod's built in one. All
item and tag values in this file will be processed regularly. However, this does not gaurentee that
your item values will be assigned if another mod already assigns a tag and its file is loaded first.

2. To assign values to items in your mod, you don't have to do a whole lot of work, as there is a
provided command to generate values for you. Instead of coding every single value by hand, you 
simply have to code values that don't have a crafting table, furnace, or smithing table recipe.
Once you have hand-coded those, you simply have to run the command "/matteroverdrive genmattervalues"
in game. The command will then assign values to items (provided they are of the three recipe types above) 
and save it under "Matter Overdrive/generated.json" in your save folder.

You can then either put this file in your mod's "matter" folder along with your "values.json" file to 
ship it directly with your mod, or make a datapack from it!

More compatibility is planned in the future for additional recipe types.

3. If you want to completely customize matter values, then it is within your power. Simply create a data
pack with a higher priority than 8, and it will override all the preset values shipped with Matter Overdrive
and other mods. However, due to the limitations of data packs, the only difference in priority is
the higher priority packs get parsed before the lower ones. In short, this means if you want to 
remove the matter value from an item added from a lower data pack, you will need to tell the parser
not to. This can be easily, albiet tediously, accomplished by assigning a value of 0 or less to the 
item in your json file. For example, say you really hate dirt, and don't want it to have a matter value.
In your custom json file, you would add the line:

    "minecraft:dirt" : 0

Any integer less than or equal to zero will technically work! Remember the tag rules from abover also
would still apply here.
