## About
Matter Overdrive is a Minecraft mod inspired by the popular Sci-fi TV series Star Trek. It dwells in the concept of replicating and transforming one type matter into another.
Although it may seem overpowered, Matter Overdrive takes a more realistic approach and requires the player to build a complex system before even the simplest replication can be achieved.
